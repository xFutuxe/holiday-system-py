# holiday-system-py
A python GUI program for my CS Coursework 2023

Overview
---------
The program will not run as is due to the database and images are not included. I will make it all public after this year's coursework is final

The idea behind it is the custom internal system for a fictional holiday renting business, in a user-friendly interface that any 'employee' can use

Issues
------------------
The current code is just an example of my understanding of Python and Tkinter and is not the final work
